            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The next is the zealous affection of the man of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing others to holy duties, <hi>O pray, &amp;c.</hi> Tis truely ſaid, that every one is a coale, if hee bee a living coale, hee will inli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven others, if a dead coale, hee will ſully others; It was our Saviours charge to <hi>Peter,</hi> thou being converted, &amp;c. and every true Diſciple will own this duty as directed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and as one candle lights another, ſo Grace where it is, will indevour to kindle Grace where it is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is life, there is a ſeminary alſo of generation, and the more excellent the life is, the more pregnant to propagate its kinde.

            <p>Miracles, ſay ſome, were the bells that tolled in hearers to the Apoſtles Sermons, good converſation comes in now in the place of Miracles, theſe Harbingers muſt make way and get intertainment for our doctrine, elſe our bad lives will quite diſcredit our great learning, as many loathe the good light of a candle for the noyſome tallows ſake.

To find out the right, our way will bee to caſt by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits of Peace. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is a <hi>Satanicall Peace,</hi> for the Devils are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to maintaine outward Peace, even where there is no order but all confuſion, leſt their kingdom ſhould come to an end; ſo one Beare will kennel with another, and the very Cannibals uſe not to eat them of their owne Country.

            <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, there is the <hi>Peace of Sampſons Foxes</hi> which were tyed together by the tailes, but all their heads were looſe, and every one looked a ſeverall way; you may ſoon diſcover here the Peace of our adverſaries, the agreement of Atheiſts and Papiſts, Prieſts and Prelates, Iriſh Rebells, and Engliſh Traytors, to ruine Church and Common-wealth, wee may read the Pedegree of Popiſh Peace and Unity, <hi>Romes</hi> ſureſt note of the Church, but though <hi>Babylons</hi> may, yet <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Peace is not found here: and I may ſay of them, as <hi>Samuel</hi> of <hi>Jeſſes</hi> ſeven Sons, <hi>the Lord hath choſen none of theſe.</hi> Heathens could ſay, there was no true friendſhip but among the good; and Chriſtians believe as an article of their Faith, no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion but of Saints; there is no Peace, ſaith God, to the wicked: as <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joram,</hi> demanding whether it were Peace, <hi>What Peace ſo long as the whoredomes of thy Mother Jezebel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>God then muſt be one in this holy League, he muſt bee principall, he muſt thinke thoughts of mercy towards his people, he muſt ſpeake peace unto them, he muſt be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us through Chriſt our eternall Peacemaker.</p>
            <p>And then ſecondly, we muſt be at Peace with God, <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Peace and holineſſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, without holineſſe there is no peace: Sin ſeparates us, Faith reunites us: <hi>O knit my heart unto thee,</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer; ſo Chriſt muſt ingratiate us into the favour of his heavenly Father, God muſt enter Covenant with man, and man muſt be in good termes with his God by faith, repentance, obedience, or there is no Peace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there muſt be a ſweet agreement betweene Prince and People, a gracious accord too of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, knit together in the inviolable bonds of loyalty and love, neither entoiled with civill broiles at home, nor infected with hoſtile inrodes from without, all profeſſing and maintaining that one eternall Truth, which is both Mother and Nurſe of Peace: Such a Peace as was enjoyed in the dayes of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> dwelt ſafely every one under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree, from <hi>Dan</hi> even to <hi>Beerſheba.</hi> And in the daies of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> when there was ſilence in Heaven for the ſpace of halfe an houre, and the ſweet odours of the Prayers of the Saints aſcended up as a cloud.

Theſe cocks are a great diſturbance to drowſie Sybarites, they cannot away with the unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clamours of ſuch wakefull birds. But we that are the Lords remembrancers muſt not keep ſilence though we be ſilenc't for it, we muſt hold our faith, and hold the truth, hold our profeſſion, and hold a good conſcience, but not hold our peace: O'tis the baſeſt tenure in all the World for any Miniſter to hold by, to hold his living, or hold his favour, hold his Peace by holding his peace. And ſo for publike peace, <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the Ammonite will make a Covenant with the men of <hi>Iabeſh Gilead,</hi> upon condition he may thruſt out al their right eyes, the <hi>Popes</hi> condition juſt, upon which he admits blinded Proſelytes into the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hezekiah</hi> may make his Peace with great <hi>Senacherib,</hi> if hee will take ſlavery with his bravery, the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> yoake with his chaine of gold, and become a Tributary King,

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:124531:8"/> to live under Antichriſt in all manner of temporall proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

            <p>And now that you have ſeen what Peace is, you will quickly perceive that it is not incident to all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, it is a choyce bleſſing, and fit for none but the choyceſt Subject, <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> To ſpeak properly, Peace is no where to bee found, but in the true Church: <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> is a City that is at unity in it ſelfe: Verity is the bond of Unity; neither can they bee truely one, that are not one in Truth.

And mee thinks men ſhould bee willing to part with any thing for a quiet life; <hi>Dulce nomen pacis.</hi> And if the very name bee ſweet and amiable, how much more the thing it ſelfe?</p>
            <p>Peace, ſure, is a moſt deſirable bleſſing, if theſe Cities, and the neighbour Counties which yet injoy it in part, know it not, ask <hi>Germany,</hi> ask <hi>Ireland,</hi> or nearer home, ask the poore plundered Countries that want it:</p>

The humbling our ſoules before our God, abhorring our ſelves, repenting in duſt and aſhes, the ſaving a poore undone Church and State from utter ruine and deſtruction; the dethroning Satan and Antichriſt, and ſetting up the Kingdome of Chriſt, over the hearts and lives of the people of the land; the laying the ſure foundation of a bleſſed peace, theſe are the great works of the day: no wonder then that every faint deſire, and impotent indevour, bee not competent to carry on ſuch great motions as theſe: No, God will have us cry and cry mightily, before hee will anſwer.</p>

So it is in our ſuites to our heavenly Father. <hi>Jacob</hi> wept and made ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had power over the Angel, and prevailed, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 4.

            <p>It is a general rule for Prayer, that the Petitions of it muſt bee practiſed as well as prayed.

            <p>And I know not how it comes to paſſe, though we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, as <hi>Jacob</hi> in his wraſtling, we goe away halting, and with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> are creepled by the fall of our enemies, and we ſpend more time in ſetting a bone, then they in making a new body. To mend this I move for a new aſſociation that zealous prayer, ſound counſell, conſtant reſolution, ſpeedy action, be firmly joyned together; let theſe as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ice, mutually produce, and bee reſolved too, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God will have mercy and not ſacrifice, and juſtice too, rather then ſacrifice; and as he is content that the acts of his owne immediate worſhip ſhould bee ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that mercy may be exerciſed, ſo alſo that juſtice may be executed. Get thee up, wherefore lyeſt thou upon thy face, ſaith the Lord to <hi>Joſhua?</hi> He is called away from his devotion to an act of Juſtice. <hi>Phinehas</hi> ſtood up and prayed, or executed judgment, the word will beare either ſenſe, and 'tis like he performed both; prayer doubtleſſe is a good preparative to Judgement, and judgment as good an inforcement to prayer. <hi>Achan</hi> muſt be ſtoned, before Iſrael could ſtand before their enemies. <hi>Jonah</hi> muſt over board, before the tempeſt would over: 'Twas not the Son
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:124531:16"/> of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> but thoſe ſons of <hi>Kiſh</hi> that hindered the Kingdoms ſettlement; ſome of that bloody houſe muſt be hanged up then before the judgment would ceaſe, and they that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iſrael, muſt be troubled now before there will bee peace.</p>
            <p>In Magiſtrates, <hi>Jacobs</hi> voice, and <hi>Eſaus</hi> rough hands are beſt welcome to God, and hee will not heare their Prayers, unleſſe their hands in this ſenſe bee full of blood. Wee thankfully acknowledge that many an excellent Ordnance hath paſſed the honourable Houſes; but <hi>cui bono?</hi> when they were but <hi>brutum fulmen,</hi> and doe no execution, when they lie ſtill as the log in the fable, till the frogs leap upon them: would you put life into them, and turne them into ſtorks; they would ſoone make them leave their inſultations; but alaſſe! now what have the harmleſſe laws done, that they ſhould be hanged up daily, till they bee dead, when De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents are ſpared?</p>
            <q>Non leges, verum figerediſce reos.</q>
            <p>I urge not for ſentences of condemnation. I ſhould bee ſorry to have Letters to excite to that: the good Emperor was ſorry hee knew Letters to write: I plead onely for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt thoſe children of death, ſuch as are dead in Law already, that a tribute of wolves heads may bee laid upon bloody <hi>Ireland,</hi> till that monſtrous generation of new Cannibals be quite rooted out: and we have too cutthroats among our ſelves; and I hope the good blood of thoſe honeſt Clothiers, that cries loud for vengeance in Gods eares, cries yet for Juſtice in yours. They have preſumed to ſet you a Copy like <hi>Draco's</hi> Lawes in blood, if you now write after it, in red inke, and capitall Letters, they may thanke themſelves; and ſeeing they have been ſo bold as to begin to their batters, make them pledge you now, and give them blood to drinke, for they are worthy. And to in large this uſe to all that heare me; know that a day of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:124531:16"/> muſt not determine with the day. God expects we ſhould battaile, as well one way by our Faſts, as by our Feaſts another; My teares have been my meat, ſayes <hi>David,</hi> and my prayers returned into mine owne boſome; we muſt live upon our prayers, and thrive by our prayers, and goe forth in the ſtrength of our prayers: our faces ſhould ſhine, and our graces ſhould ſhine after wee have been faſting, as <hi>Moſes</hi> with God in the Mount: ſhew mee not the meat, but ſhew me the man; we ſhould ſhew forth the effect of our humiliation in our reformation; by our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence we ſhould pine our fleſh, and ſtarve our ſinnes, and our repentant teares ſhould bee a <hi>Noahs</hi> flood to drowne all our old world, that there may bee a new face of things, a new man, a new creature, al things new. And for the point in hand, you muſt not thinke your worke done when your prayers are ended, you muſt then act over your prayers, and live over your prayers: the Sermon ended ſay not it is done, that part is wanting yet, and reſts in thee, thy life muſt be the reall Sermon. Follow Peace, ſaies the Apoſtle, we muſt pray for peace and follow peace, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, follow it with earneſtneſſe, though it fly from you purſue it though, and purſue too the things that belong to your peace, and purſue too the enemies of your Peace, there is no ſinne ſure in that kind of perſecution; when I ſee ſo many Military men about the City, me thinkes I might put to them the Angels queſtion, What doſt thou here <hi>Eliah?</hi> T'was a worthy ſpeech of a brave Souldier, My Lord <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> and the Armies of Iſrael are encamped in the open fields, ſhall I then goe downe to my houſe? and would not he ſolace himſelfe with his lawfull conſort: what make they then in unlawfull beds? Is my Lord <hi>Joab,</hi> and the Armies of Iſrael encamped in open fields: what do theſe then ſhrouding themſelves under the umbrage of every Vintners buſh, ſwaggering in <hi>Meſeck,</hi> and revelling in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:124531:17"/> Tents of <hi>Kedar?</hi> What doſt thou here <hi>Uriah?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Nos patriam fugimus, tu Tytire lentus in umbra.</q>
            <p>And for the reſt, you muſt not ſit ſtill neither, but up and be doing, your heads, your hearts, your hands, your purſes, all muſt be ſtirring here, all working for Peace, not onely muſt the rich caſt into Gods treaſuries of their ſuperfluities but their ſubſtance too, the pooreſt widowher mite, &amp; every one not only his <hi>mite,</hi> but his <hi>might</hi> alſo we ſhould al lay out ourſelves in all our abilities, even ſtretch our ſelves to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt poſſibilities, ready to ſpend and bee ſpent upon the purchaſe of peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for an uſe of exhortation, the duty that I preſſe is no lip labour, there is more in it then aske and have, pray and ſpeed; the Kingdome of heaven ſuffers violence, and the violent take it by force; wee muſt even beſiege Heaven with our united forces, and raiſe ſuch batteries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods gates, that we may breake open thoſe everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting doores, and plunder all his treaſures of eternity; and now mee thinkes, that wee feele it comming, wee ſhould ſet all our ſhoulders to the work, and as the Apoſtle bids, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſtrive together as fellow ſouldiers with a full concurrence of all our might; we muſt even compaſſe <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> as the Iſraelites did <hi>Jericho,</hi> yet ſeven times more in one day; and ſhout againſt it with a great ſhout, before the walls will come downe, and the Angell cry, <hi>Babylon</hi> is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, is fallen.</p>
            <p>My laſt adreſſe ſhall be to you, worthy Fathers of your Countrey, and all that looke for redemption in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in a word of Conſolation. The moſt looke upon the armies of troubles that are muſtered up againſt this poore Church and State, as <hi>Eliſha's</hi> Servant upon the great Hoſt of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> about <hi>Dothan,</hi> and cry out as he, Alaſſe Maſter, how ſhall we doe? but it may be anſwered with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet there, Feare not, for they that bee with us, are more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:124531:17"/> then they that be with them, and would the Lord but open our eyes we might behold the mountain filed with horſes of fire &amp; Charets of fire round about us, when at Chriſts word we have walked oft upon the proud waves of a roring ſea, ſeene their rage and tumult broken into foame, and ebbing into emptineſſe, yet when a ſtronger guſt then ordinary blows upon us, we are ready to cry out with <hi>Peter</hi> in his feare, Lord ſave us we periſh; and we well deſerve to be chid for it, why are yee fearfull, O yee of little faith? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cockboat can ſaile in a river, every Scule can live in a calme. God hath embarqued you, VVorthy Pilots, in the good Ship called the Victory; this is the victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth, even your faith; and you have by you the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of hope, the Sheat-Anchor that will hold, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tackling failes, and therefore though the blackeſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt riſeth, &amp; one deep calleth, &amp;c. you may ride on though the great billows rowles towards you, even in the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfloods your ſpirits need not faint, nor your heart faile; but you may lift up the creſt, and bear up your heads; and be of good cheare, You carry not <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but Chriſt: Nay, as in the old Embleme of Saint <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> you beare not Chriſt, but Chriſt beares you: They can never ſink that have the Word for their Compaſſe, and Chriſt for the Helme. 'Twas the pious preſumption of holy <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> wherewith hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted <hi>Monica Auſtins</hi> Mother then a Manichee, whom ſhe had daily with much importunity recommended to the Throne of Grace, <hi>Impoſsibile eſt ut filius iſtarum lachryma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pereat,</hi> It is impoſſible that a Sonne of ſo many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and teares ſhould die an hereticke. And may wee not much more with an humble confidtnce build upon the mercy of God, for the preſervation and deliverance of this poor afflicted Church and State, which have been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſo much godly ſorrow in ſo many dayes of publike and private humiliation? It is beyond all beliefe, that a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:124531:18"/> Mother Church, a Mother State, of ſo many prayers and teares, ſhould ever ſit as a widow, mourning like <hi>Rachel;</hi> that ſuch a <hi>Bochim,</hi> a place of weepers, ſhould be turn'd into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celdama,</hi> a field of blood. Right Honourable and ever Honoured Patiots, God will give you beauty for aſhes, the garments of joy for the ſpirit of heavineſſe; and as you have beene <hi>Ben-onies,</hi> the Sons of our ſorrow, ſo God will make you his <hi>Benjamins,</hi> the Sonnes of his right hand, and the Kingdomes joy. That man ſure is in a good way of thriving, that hath a ſtock going in every part of the Kingdome at once: So our Parliament, our Armies, our Navy, when they have a ſtock of Prayers going for them in every part of the Proteſtant World, when they have ſo many able Factors and Agents negotiating for them at the throne of grace; one <hi>Paul</hi> ſaved the lives of all in the Ship. One innocent delivers the Iſland. And ſhall not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Pauls,</hi> and many innocents much more doe it now? One <hi>Eliah,</hi> and one <hi>Eliſha</hi> were the Charets of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof; and ſhall not many ſuch bee Armies Royall, and Navies Royall now? If one righteous man were found in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the Lord would pardon it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. If ten righteous had been found in <hi>Sodome</hi> it ſelfe, God would not deſtroy it for tens ſake. Hath God forgotten to be gracious, wil he ſhut up his loving kindnes in diſpleaſure when ſo many righteous are in this Kingdom, &amp; in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wil he make it like <hi>Sodome,</hi> and make it like <hi>Gomorrah?</hi>
